# Is this gem ready for Rails 4?

**NOTE**: Currently, we only support Rails 4.

[Ready4Rails.net](http://www.ready4rails.net) lists many gems and shows whether they are ready
for Rails 4 or not. You can also paste your Gemfile to get a one-click report
of the status of your Gemfile gems.

## Thanks to

* all the people who report new gem statuses and add new gems to the site
* [Amar Raja](https://github.com/amarraja) for implementing the feature allowing the users to paste their Gemfiles
